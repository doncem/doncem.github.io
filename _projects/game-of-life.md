Since I don't even remember when.. from the moment I read about Game of Life in one book about games one can play I never lost the excitement about it. During childhood sometimes full carpet was laid with various tools representing living cells and I could go for hours. Then Macromedia Flash came. And so on..

Of course, after school when I started studies, there were a lot of other activities to take care so obviously such excitement has gone but I'm always happy to see such development in one or another place. So here's a nasty javascript code (to run on this window!)

<div id="game-of-life-container" style="position:fixed;top:0px;left:0px;display:none;">
  <canvas id="game-of-life-canvas"></canvas>
</div>
