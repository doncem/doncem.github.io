Refurbished web for Atma with latest technology using wordpress continuous integration.
I believe Atma is a society who tries to propagate health for humans based on hindu or whichever branch(es) from the area are.
Initial template I choose pretty slick and neutral, as requested, but then I gave access to customers to update their vision as they seem to fit.
To my eyes it wasn't quite "neutrally coloured".

The project and idea was great from technical perpective. And I think wordpress provided with everything I needed:
- Event calendar
- Event tickets/bookings
- Gallery which is represented as blog entry

Everything was pretty much implemented but... Classical customer-developer conversation happened and never agreed on technicalities.
Therefore test website stayed on my personal hosting account until late 2016 - when moved away from hosting to GitHub pages

Probably last straw for me doing any websites for others than work entitlement
