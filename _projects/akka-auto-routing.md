An idea came while dealing with multiple microservices at work and constantly having to manage resource endpoints.
Wanted to simply define them and apply service method.
Probably sounds like already done by Play framework, but it's quite a huge library and really didn't want get down that road.
Moreover, I got the chance to face the difficulties myself!
