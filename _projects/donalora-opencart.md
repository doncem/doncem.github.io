As a family and as a distinguished provider we launched the DonaLora shop to put out on the market some decent yarns which are not easy to find in UK. Especially when main goal to customers is/are "acrylic" yarn. No further comments. This has to be fixed and DonaLora is trying to do that. Unfortunately it is hard to mend the human mind but at least I can do that via my own page by saying all this. Please support. Please buy. Please spread the word
