During busy young family time schedule alongside providing extra services out there, we tried to push [DonaLora](https://www.donalora.com) out there with help of outsourced developer.
Unfortunately, the result was not as pleasing as we would hope.
As time went by, we thought of a more specific name and keeping DonaLora as a mother of all the things mastermind wife has thought of - making Thread Of Fashion one of them.
Specific, direct, straight to the point.
This time I took the hardwork task in putting up web.
With OpenCart experience I definitely did not want to go with "free" option and chose this complex, SEO friendly CMS - Wix.
My dear it was a shocker in getting over usual CMSs I've seen.
But seems to be doing pretty good.
Well done product
