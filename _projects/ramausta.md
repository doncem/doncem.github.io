A quick mock-up for private company "Ramausta" situated in Vilnius, Lithuania.
Website is purely for representing the company as a retailer.
Design made by ArÅ«nas

I was still very strict about using CMS.
Took same technologies I've been using for years which gave me flexibility.
Design-wise some elements were really hard

Personal opinion: I believe marketing could be done differently giving the line of business they are running.
Personal web is a good initiative just poorly executed and I did not receive any requests for updates.
So it stayed in a, kind of, WIP state
