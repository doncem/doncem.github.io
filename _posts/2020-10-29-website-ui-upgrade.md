## Intro
I've been delaying this work for some time now.
And by _this_ I mean just any (re)work.
It has been hard choice initially to go with SemanticUI.
It looked nice back then.
So it lived long here in this repo.
Until I saw Microsoft Teams in one of the workplaces I immediatelly started to hate it.

The re-work was bound to happen.

## History

As a normal back-end developer with some knowledge on other things too - I googled.
Something amond those lines like _css frameworks_ etc.
Bulma was there too.
But my I caught SemanticUI.
Thought _well that's different compared to any other web for sure_.
Which was my goal and it worked out well.

Yes, theming is a bit dark.
Fit for flavours around development time ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

But main reason still stays: Microsoft.
Uuuurgh..
Once I moved to Linux I completely lost the love there.

## TL;DR

So enough talk, let's see the transition in pics!
BTW, Bulma is more mobile friendly than SemanticUI so.. win win?

## Other matter

* Removed jQuery!
* Removed AMP BS
* Pygments moved to Darcula theme
* Just in general - I think it's simpler now. I can focus more on content rather than style
