about: |
  I am a software engineer with over 5 years of experience in PHP and MySQL.
  And 2 years of intense Scala learning curve, applied in building multi micro-service API platform.
  My personal experiments are mostly developed with latest libs cloned from Git repositories.

  I consider myself an efficient worker who always tries to make use of best practices and I like to keep up-to-date with programming theory.
