          <p>I am a software engineer who got sucked into the world of internet. Journey started as a functional php front-end based copy-paster and look where it got me now. Doing some serious Scala multi-microservice jugglery to serve different purpose of API</p>
          <p>No surprise occasionally have to get my mittens into doing some DevOps which I don't quite fancy but hey - sometimes it has to be done</p>
          <p>At the beginning of 2016 I have also been assigned to lead the team of Juniors who showed up quite knowledgeable and driven - very kean to learn and produce good results for sophisticated software</p>
